I am a 5th year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Utah. I received a B.Tech. in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur.

Research Interests
---
I am working towards understanding ML models through the lens of Computational Topology and Visualization. I believe that the strong mathematical foundations of topological analysis and interactive capabilities through visualization techniques can pave a path to traverse the inherently complex structures of ML models, especially in the context of deep learning. I am creating frameworks for Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and visualization to analyze and reason about deep learning models, as a step towards explainable and interpretable ML.
